# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 29, 2026

## Introduction

Commentation is a free and open-source collaboration tool. This privacy policy explains how we handle data when you use Commentation.

## What is Commentation?

Commentation is self-hosted software that you run on your own infrastructure. We (the Commentation project maintainers) do not host any services or collect any data from your use of the software.

## Data Collection

### By the Commentation Project

**We collect no data.** The Commentation project does not:
- Collect personal information
- Track usage analytics
- Store comments or user data
- Use cookies or tracking technologies
- Share data with third parties

### By You (Self-Hosted)

When you install and run Commentation on your own infrastructure:
- **You control all data.** All comments, user names, and project data are stored locally in your environment.
- **You set the rules.** You are responsible for how data is collected, stored, and processed in your deployment.
- **Local storage only.** By default, Commentation stores data in `.commentation/data.json` on your server or in-memory during development.

## Third-Party Services

Commentation integrates with:
- **GitHub (optional):** If you enable GitHub Issues sync, comments may be synced to GitHub Issues. GitHub's privacy policy applies to that data.

## Your Responsibilities

When you deploy Commentation, you become the data controller. You should:
- Inform your users how their data (names, comments) will be used
- Comply with applicable privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) in your jurisdiction
- Implement appropriate security measures
- Provide your own privacy policy for your deployment

## Open Source

Commentation is open source (MIT License). You can review the entire codebase at [github.com/joelbodker/commentation](https://github.com/joelbodker/commentation) to verify how data is handled.

## Changes to This Policy

Since we collect no data, this policy is unlikely to change. Any updates will be posted to this file in the GitHub repository.

**Summary:** Commentation is self-hosted software. We collect nothing. You control everything.
